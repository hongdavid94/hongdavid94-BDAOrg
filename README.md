Description of Data Analysis Problem:

My career interest is centered around the role of statistical analysis in the realm of health sector. More specifically, I am interested in learning how statistical analysis can be used in clinical research. The questions that I want to answer after I finish my undergraduate and, most likely, my masterâ€™s degree in statistics are the following: How effective is this particular drug/procedure? How does the effectiveness vary by ethnicity, age, and other indicators? What are some common indicators among the patients?

The image here is an example of data analysis to understand the efficacy of the drug (called ARISTADA or Aripiprazole Laurixil) varied by gender and dosage. In here, it shows that PANSS or Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score decreased for schizophrenia patients in higher dose of the drug. The drug worked similarily to both genders.
